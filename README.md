# CS50-Final-Project
This is for Harvard's CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science.

It's a Solver for the Aggregate Planning problem in Supply Chain Management and Production Management. It uses Dynamic Programming so it's efficient and flexible. You can adapt it to solve very large datasets.

Thank you!
